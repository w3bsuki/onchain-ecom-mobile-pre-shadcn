## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Optimization
- Implement image optimization with Next.js
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Optimize component rendering with React.memo where appropriate
- Implement efficient data fetching patterns

### Responsive Design Approach
- Mobile-first CSS implementation
- Breakpoint system: 
  - Mobile: <640px
  - Tablet: 640px-1024px
  - Desktop: >1024px
- Use of CSS Container Queries for component-specific responsiveness

### Component Architecture
- Follow atomic design principles:
  - Atoms: Basic UI components (buttons, inputs)
  - Molecules: Combinations of atoms (search bars, product cards)
  - Organisms: Complex UI sections (navigation, product lists)
  - Templates: Page layouts
  - Pages: Complete interfaces

## Testing Strategy
- Mobile device testing matrix
- Performance monitoring
- Usability testing protocol
- Conversion funnel analytics

## Success Criteria
- Mobile Lighthouse score > 90
- Cart abandonment rate decrease by 15%
- Average page load time < 1.5s
- Checkout completion time < 2 minutes
- User satisfaction score > 4/5

## Timeline
